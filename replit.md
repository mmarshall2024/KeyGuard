# OMNICore Bot

## Overview

OMNICore Bot is a comprehensive, self-evolving Telegram bot platform built with Flask and python-telegram-bot. The system provides a modular architecture for managing bot functionality through plugins, integrates payment processing via Stripe and cryptocurrency, and includes an admin panel for system management. The bot features advanced AI-driven capabilities including natural conversation, usage pattern analysis, automated feature suggestions, mutation-based evolution, continuous system observation, and multi-layered security protection. The system supports automatic updates from GitHub, health monitoring, backup management, and dynamic plugin loading with autonomous optimization capabilities.
